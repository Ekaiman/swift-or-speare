# Swift or Speare

## Overview
Swift or Speare is a game where users have a selected amount of time to guess as many quotes as they can. Users are guessing if the quote is Taylor Swift or Shakespeare

Quotes are generated at random and once time runs out, users are directed to an end game screen where they can see their score.
